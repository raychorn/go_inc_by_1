This is a simple state-machine where the first digit on the right is increments by 1 followed-by 
rippling the addition to the next digit if necessary with the edge condition being the last
digit to the left being reset on carry from greater than 9.  Notice the option to roll the
odometer or not which was added after the code had been  written.
